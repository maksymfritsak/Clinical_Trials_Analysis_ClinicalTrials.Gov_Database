# Importance and Objective
**Over the past two decades, the entire field of oncology has witnessed significant growth in clinical trial activity, yet a comprehensive examination of this landscape has been lacking.**

**This study provides a meticulous analysis of radiation oncology clinical trials from 2003 to 2023 to identify key trends, patterns, and challenges in the field.**

# Design and Setting
**A comprehensive retrospective analysis of publicly registered clinical trials was conducted, focusing on trials related to radiation therapy and cancer treatment.**

**Publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov provided the basis for this study, encompassing a global scope of trial activity.**

# Participants
**All clinical trials registered on the database were screened, and 4,253 radiation oncology trials were included into this analysis.**

# Main Outcomes and Measures
**Key outcomes examined included trends in trial activity over time, distribution of trials by organ system, geographic location of trials, and phase of clinical trials conducted.**

# Results
**Over the past 20 years, there was a trend to more clinical trial activity in radiation oncology, leading to the registration of 4,253 comprehensively reported radiation oncology trials on ClinicalTrials.gov by February 8th, 2024. The most frequently investigated organ systems were the digestive system, the central nervous system, and the head and neck site, making up 2,113 (49.7%) of all registered studies. While oligometastasis emerged as a newly studied disease entity over the last decade (n=95, 2.2%), hematology represents the only organ system where significant decreased trial activity was observed over time (n=413, 9.7%). The large majority of registered studies were phase II trials (n=2,181, 51.3%); most studies continue to emanate from North America (n=2,477, 58.2%), while Europe (n=903, 21.2%) and Asia (n=1,072, 25.2%) represent relevant and rising shares over time. Only about 6% radiation oncology trials received industry funding.**

# Conclusions and Relevance
**These findings highlight the dynamic nature of radiation oncology research, emphasizing the importance of global effort to address regional disparities, to test novel technology and drug-radiotherapy combinations in phase I trials as well as to conduct phase III trials to translate promising therapies into clinical practice, and to increase efforts to obtain industry funding for radiation oncology trials.**
